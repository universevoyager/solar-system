## Scientific Data Sources (SolarSystemData.json)

The JSON dataset includes:
- mean radii (km),
- sidereal rotation periods,
- axial tilts,
- orbital periods,
- semi-major axes,
- selected Keplerian orbital elements for a few solar objects to visualize eccentric/tilted orbits.

Primary sources used (trustworthy references):

### Planets (physical + orbital basics)
- JPL Solar System Dynamics — Planetary Physical Parameters
